abstract={Software-Defined Networking (SDN) aims to alleviate the limitations imposed by traditional IP networks by decoupling network tasks performed on each device in particular planes. This approach offers several benefits, such as standard communication protocols, centralized network functions, and specific network elements, for example, controller devices. Despite these benefits, there is still a lack of adequate support for performing tasks related to traffic classification, because (i) there are traffic profiles that are very similar, which makes their classification difficult (e.g., Both HTTP and DNS flows are characterized by packet bursts), (ii) Open Flow, the key SDN implementation today, only offers native flow features, such as packet and byte count, that do not describe intrinsic traffic profiles, and (iii) there is a lack of support to determine what is the optimal set of flow features to characterize different types of traffic profiles. In this paper, we introduce an architecture to collect, extend, and select flow features for traffic classification in Open Flow-based networks. The main goal of our solution is to offer an extensive set of flow features that can be analyzed and refined and to be capable of finding the optimal subset of features to classify different types of traffic flows. The experimental evaluation of our proposal shows that some features emerge as meaningful, occupying the top positions for the classification of distinct flows in different experimental scenarios.},

abstract={In this paper, a QoS-aware traffic classification framework for software defined networks is proposed. Instead of identifying specific applications in most of the previous work of traffic classification, our approach classifies the network traffic into different classes according to the QoS requirements, which provide the crucial information to enable the fine-grained and QoS-aware traffic engineering. The proposed framework is fully located in the network controller so that the real-time, adaptive, and accurate traffic classification can be realized by exploiting the superior computation capacity, the global visibility, and the inherent programmability of the network controller. More specifically, the proposed framework jointly exploits deep packet inspection (DPI) and semi-supervised machine learning so that accurate traffic classification can be realized, while requiring minimal communications between the network controller and the SDN switches. Based on the real Internet data set, the simulation results show the proposed classification framework can provide good performance in terms of classification accuracy and communication costs.},

This application concerns the problem of predicting the size of a flow and detecting elephant flows (very large flows). Flow size is a very important statistic that can be used to improve routing, load balancing and scheduling in computer networks. Flow size prediction is particularly challenging since flow patterns continuously change and predictions must be done in real time (milliseconds) to avoid delays. We describe how to formulate the problem as an online machine learning task to continuously adjust to changes in flow traffic. We evaluate the predictive nature of a set of features and the accuracy of three online predictors based on neural networks, Gaussian process regression and online Bayesian Moment Matching on three datasets of real traffic. We also demonstrate how to use such online predictors to improve routing (i.e., reduced flow completion time) in a network simulation.},

abstract="In this paper, we solve a mapping problem related to supporting two service classes that are differentiated based on their level of protection. The first class of service, called Fully Protected (FP), offers end-users a guarantee of survivability in the case of a single failure; all FP traffic is protected using either a 1:1 or 1 + 1 protection scheme at the WDM layer. The second class of service, called Best-Effort Protected (BEP), is not protected; instead restoration at the IP layer is provided. When a failure occurs, the network restores as much BEP traffic as possible, and thus BEP traffic does not receive any specific guarantees. The FP service class mimics what Internet users receive today. The BEP traffic is designed to run over the large amounts of unused bandwidth that exist in today's Internet. The motivation of this approach is to give carriers a mechanism for increasing the load carried on backbone networks without reducing the QoS received by existing customers. In order to support two such services, the logical links at the IP layer need to be carefully mapped onto primary and backup paths at the optical layer. We incorporate into our mapping problem a number of practical requirements that reflect constraints that carriers face and policies they want to enforce. For example, we allow the FP demand to be specified via a traffic matrix at the IP layer, we include an overprovisioning factor that specifies the portion of each link that must be left unused, and we incorporate a minimal fairness requirement on how the BEP traffic is allocated among connections. Our goal is to quantify how much BEP traffic can be carried in addition to the FP traffic, without impacting the protection quality of the FP traffic even in the case of failure, and without impacting the FP load. We provide two solutions, one is an optimal solution using an Integer Linear Program (ILP) model, and the other is an algorithm based on the Tabu Search (TS) methodology. Our heuristic algorithm allows us to solve this problem for large networks such as those spanning the continental US. We show that by having two such classes of service, the load on a network can be increased by a factor of 4--7 (depending upon the network). We illustrate that even with overprovisioning and fairness requirements (both of which reduce the total possible BEP load carried), we can still typically triple the total network load. We show that the location of the bottleneck can affect whether or not we see a difference in performance between 1:1 or 1 + 1 protection schemes. Our results illustrate the gain in terms of additional BEP load carried that can be obtained simply due to the upgrade of a single link. Our proposal provides carriers a new vehicle for generating revenue by extracting benefit from all the sources of unused bandwidth in networks.",

Started as a scalable tool to continuously monitor packets that flow on a link, Tstat has evolved into a complex application that gives to network researchers and operators the possibility to derive extended and complex measurements. Tstat offers the capability to track traffic flows, it integrates advanced behavioral classifiers that identify the application that has generated a flow, and automatically derives performance indexes that allow to easily characterize both network usage and users' activity. After describing Tstat capabilities and internal design, in this paper we present some examples of measurements collected deploying Tstat at the edge of our campus network for the past years.",

abstract = "Abstract The Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm establishes a typical three-plane architecture (i.e., Data, Control, and Application planes) that facilitates the deployment of network functions and simplifies traditional network management tasks. However, SDN lacks an integrated or standardized framework for managing its architecture. Some investigations have addressed such shortage by proposing different solutions that tackle specific management requirements for particular SDN technology instances. This isolated approach forces network administrators to use multiple frameworks to achieve a complete SDN management that is complex and time-consuming in heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we introduce an information model based on the common information model that establishes a technology-agnostic and consistent characterization of the SDN architecture. Such information model represents the core towards building a Management Plane aimed to facilitate the integrated SDN management in heterogeneous environments. To test our information model, we developed a prototype and conducted a performance evaluation in an SDN configuration scenario that deploys different managing technologies. The obtained results provide directions that corroborate the feasibility of our approach (in terms of time-response and network traffic) for configuring heterogeneous SDNs."

A taxonomy of routing algorithms in the literature is provided, dating from the advent of the TE concept in the late 1990s. We classify the algorithms into multiple dimensions: unicast/multicast, intra-/inter- domain, IP-/MPLS-based and offline/online TE schemes. In addition, we investigate some important traffic engineering issues, including robustness, TE interactions, and interoperability with overlay selfish routing. In addition to a review of existing solutions, we also point out some challenges in TE operation and important issues that are worthy of investigation in future research activities.},

abstract={The cost of failures within communication networks is significant and will only increase as their reach further extends into the way our society functions. Some aspects of network resilience, such as the application of fault-tolerant systems techniques to optical switching, have been studied and applied to great effect. However, networks - and the Internet in particular - are still vulnerable to malicious attacks, human mistakes such as misconfigurations, and a range of environmental challenges. We argue that this is, in part, due to a lack of a holistic view of the resilience problem, leading to inappropriate and difficult-to-manage solutions. In this article, we present a systematic approach to building resilient networked systems. We first study fundamental elements at the framework level such as metrics, policies, and information sensing mechanisms. Their understanding drives the design of a distributed multilevel architecture that lets the network defend itself against, detect, and dynamically respond to challenges. We then use a concrete case study to show how the framework and mechanisms we have developed can be applied to enhance resilience.},

abstract="In this paper we present OpenTM, a traffic matrix estimation system for OpenFlow networks. OpenTM uses built-in features provided in OpenFlow switches to directly and accurately measure the traffic matrix with a low overhead. Additionally, OpenTM uses the routing information learned from the OpenFlow controller to intelligently choose the switches from which to obtain flow statistics, thus reducing the load on switching elements. We explore several algorithms for choosing which switches to query, and demonstrate that there is a trade-off between accuracy of measurements, and the worst case maximum load on individual switches, i.e., the perfect load balancing scheme sometimes results in the worst estimate, and the best estimation can lead to worst case load distribution among switches. We show that a non-uniform distribution querying strategy that tends to query switches closer to the destination with a higher probability has a better performance compared to the uniform schemes. Our test-bed experiments show that for a stationary traffic matrix OpenTM normally converges within ten queries which is considerably faster than existing traffic matrix estimation techniques for traditional IP networks.",

abstract={Network controller is the core of the OpenFlow-Based Software-Defined Networks (SDN). High availability of network controller is an urgent need objectively. The appearance of controller instance fault should not be perceived by data plane. During the fault recovery, OpenFlow messages, especially asynchronous message from data plane, should not be discarded. Otherwise the control platform would hold the outdated network status. This is an interesting problem which we call Asynchronous Message Discard (ASMD) trouble. This paper proposes a Non-stop network controller (NSNC). It can troubleshoot the ASMD problem based on highly available TCP (HA-TCP) technology. During the fault recovery on distributed control platform, we want to elect the optimal controller to take over the network devices managed by the failed controller instance. We analyses the minimum metrics set for controller election. The view of this paper is verified on Floodlight controller. Experiments show that when the controller instance fails, asynchronous messages from switch will not be discarded, and using HA-TCP only adds negligible overhead to throughput and latency. We test the performance of election algorithm based on Mininet. Currently, there is only a theoretical analysis of metrics related to the election. We will test the validity of the election strategy in a real scenario as part of our future work.},

abstract={In the discussion about Future Internet, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), enabled by OpenFlow, is currently seen as one of the most promising paradigm. While the availability and scalability concerns rises as a single controller could be alleviated by using replicate or distributed controllers, there lacks a flexible mechanism to allow controller load balancing. This paper proposes BalanceFlow, a controller load balancing architecture for OpenFlow networks. By utilizing CONTROLLER X action extension for OpenFlow switches and cross-controller communication, one of the controllers, called “super controller”, can flexibly tune the flow-requests handled by each controller, without introducing unacceptable propagation latencies. Experiments based on real topology show that BalanceFlow can adjust the load of each controller dynamically.},

abstract={Software Defined Networking is a networking paradigm which allows network operators to manage networking elements using software running on an external server. This is accomplished by a split in the architecture between the forwarding element and the control element. Two technologies which allow this split for packet networks are For CES and Openflow. We present energy efficiency and resilience aspects of carrier grade networks which can be met by Openflow. We implement flow restoration and run extensive experiments in an emulated carrier grade network. We show that Openflow can restore traffic quite fast, but its dependency on a centralized controller means that it will be hard to achieve 50 ms restoration in large networks serving many flows. In order to achieve 50 ms recovery, protection will be required in carrier grade networks.},

This paper focuses on fault tolerance of OpenFlow to deploy it in carrier-grade networks. The carrier-grade network has a strict requirement that the network should recover from the failure within a 50ms interval. We apply two well-known recovery mechanisms to OpenFlow networks: restoration and protection, and run extensive emulation experiments. In OpenFlow, the controlling software is moved to one or more hardware modules (controllers) which can control many switches. For fast failure recovery, the controller must notify all the affected switches about the recovery action within ms interval. This leads to a significant load on the controller. We show that OpenFlow may not be able to achieve failure recovery within a 50ms interval in this situation. We add the recovery action in the switches themselves so that the switches can do recovery without contacting the controller. We show that this approach can achieve recovery within 50ms in a large-scale network serving many flows."

abstract={Metro and carrier-grade Ethernet networks, as well as industrial area networks and specific local area networks (LANs), have to guarantee fast resiliency upon network failure. However, the current OpenFlow architecture, originally designed for LANs, does not include effective mechanisms for fast resiliency. In this paper, the OpenFlow architecture is enhanced to support segment protection in Ethernet-based networks. Novel mechanisms have been specifically introduced to maintain working and backup flows at different priorities and to guarantee effective network resource utilization when the failed link is recovered. Emulation and experimental demonstration implementation results show that the proposed architecture avoids both the utilization of a full-state controller and the intervention of the controller upon failure, thus guaranteeing a recovery time only due to the failure detection time, i.e., a few tens of milliseconds within the considered scenario.},

abstract="Applications running in modern datacenters interact with the underlying network in complex ways, making administrators run multiple traffic management tasks to tune the system. However, today's traffic management solutions are limited by an artificial division between the hosts and the network. While network devices only have knowledge of the network layer, the hosts can provide more visibility into how applications interact with the network. This paper proposes to extend the scope of traffic management to the end-host network stack. We present a software-defined networking platform for joint HOst-NEtwork (HONE) traffic management. HONE presents a uniform view of a diverse collection of measurement data, minimizes measurement overhead by performing lazy materialization of fine-grained statistics, and scales the analysis by processing data locally on the end hosts. HONE offers a simple and expressive programming framework for network and service administrators. We evaluate HONE by implementing several canonical traffic management applications, measuring its efficiency with micro-benchmarks, and demonstrating its scalability with larger experiments on Amazon EC2.",

abstract={Software Defined Networking promises to simplify network management tasks by separating the control plane (a central controller) from the data plane (switches). OpenFlow has emerged as the de facto standard for communication between the controller and switches. Apart from providing flow control and communication interfaces, OpenFlow provides a flow level statistics collection mechanism from the data plane. It exposes a high level interface for per flow and aggregate statistics collection. Network applications can use this high level interface to monitor network status without being concerned about the low level details. In order to keep the switch design simple, this statistics collection mechanism is implemented as a pull-based service, i.e. network applications and in turn the controller has to periodically query the switches about flow statistics. The frequency of polling the switches determines monitoring accuracy and network overhead. In this paper, we focus on this trade-off between monitoring accuracy, timeliness and network overhead. We propose PayLess - a monitoring framework for SDN. PayLess provides a flexible RESTful API for flow statistics collection at different aggregation levels. It uses an adaptive statistics collection algorithm that delivers highly accurate information in real-time without incurring significant network overhead. We utilize the Floodlight controller's API to implement the proposed monitoring framework. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated through emulations in Mininet.},

Traffic engineering (TE) is an important network application, which studies measurement and management of network traffic, and designs reasonable routing mechanisms to guide network traffic to improve utilization of network resources, and better meet requirements of the network quality of service (QoS). Compared with the traditional networks, the SDN has many advantages to support TE due to its distinguish characteristics, such as isolation of control and forwarding, global centralized control, and programmability of network behavior. This paper focuses on the traffic engineering technology based on the SDN. First, we propose a reference framework for TE in the SDN, which consists of two parts, traffic measurement and traffic management. Traffic measurement is responsible for monitoring and analyzing real-time network traffic, as a prerequisite for traffic management. In the proposed framework, technologies related to traffic measurement include network parameters measurement, a general measurement framework, and traffic analysis and prediction; technologies related to traffic management include traffic load balancing, QoS-guarantee scheduling, energy-saving scheduling, and traffic management for the hybrid IP/SDN. Current existing technologies are discussed in detail, and our insights into future development of TE in the SDN are offered.},

abstract = "Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging networking paradigm that separates the network control plane from the data forwarding plane with the promise to dramatically improve network resource utilization, simplify network management, reduce operating cost, and promote innovation and evolution. Although traffic engineering techniques have been widely exploited in the past and current data networks, such as ATM networks and IP/MPLS networks, to optimize the performance of communication networks by dynamically analyzing, predicting, and regulating the behavior of the transmitted data, the unique features of SDN require new traffic engineering techniques that exploit the global network view, status, and flow patterns/characteristics available for better traffic control and management. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in traffic engineering for SDNs, and mainly focuses on four thrusts including flow management, fault tolerance, topology update, and traffic analysis/characterization. In addition, some existing and representative traffic engineering tools from both industry and academia are explained. Moreover, open research issues for the realization of SDN traffic engineering solutions are discussed in detail."

It is widely recognised that the Internet is not sufficiently resilient, survivable, and dependable, and that significant research, development, and engineering is necessary to improve the situation. This paper provides an architectural framework for resilience and survivability in communication networks and provides a survey of the disciplines that resilience encompasses, along with significant past failures of the network infrastructure. A resilience strategy is presented to defend against, detect, and remediate challenges, a set of principles for designing resilient networks is presented, and techniques are described to analyse network resilience."

abstract={Software Defined Networking (SDN) has recently emerged as a hot topic deserving strong interest both from academia and industry. The change it advises of logically centralizing the overall network control on software platforms and applications, turns networks more and more into software-based systems. Such paradigm shift enables to build more manageable, agile and smarter data communication infrastructures. Despite the interest it is deserving on a multitude of physical and virtualized infrastructures, currently there are no systematic approaches of characterizing and comparing alternative SDN-based solutions regarding their resilience -- a characteristic of utmost importance on such critical environments. In this paper we present a tentative path to bridge this gap, by proposing a research agenda to advance resilience benchmarks for SDNs. We believe that with such class of tools and methodologies, researchers, developers and practitioners will become in a better position to advance the area and take more informed decisions.},

abstract={New and different trends in networks have been promoted in recent years, among these, Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) has emerged as an initiative from the industry (manufacturers and network operators) in order to increase the flexibility of deployment and integration of new network services within operator's networks. This is achieved through the implementation of network functions such as firewalls, encryption, filtering, load balancing, among others, via software modules. The idea is to avoid using devices based in specific hardware appliances and increase return on investment. Transforming network functions in software allows to run them on different general purpose equipment that could be located in a variety of telecommunications infrastructure, including data centers, network nodes, and even in end-user facilities, also such network functions can be moved or migrated from one equipment to another easily without the need to install new specialized hardware. This article presents a state of the art on network functions virtualization, also it proposes a classification of the main projects that are working under this paradigm. Finally, use cases and future challenges in this area are discussed.},

The abstractions supported by this architecture are intended to simplify the implementation of several tasks that are critical to network operation, such as routing and network management. Computer networks have an increasingly important societal role, requiring them to be resilient to a range of challenges. Previously, research into network resilience has focused on the mitigation of several types of challenges, such as natural disasters and attacks. Capitalizing on its benefits, including increased programmability and a clearer separation of concerns, significant attention has recently focused on the development of resilience mechanisms that use software-defined networking approaches. In this article, we present a survey that provides a structured overview of the resilience support that currently exists in this important area. We categorize the most recent research on this topic with respect to a number of resilience disciplines. Additionally, we discuss the lessons learned from this investigation, highlight the main challenges faced by SDNs moving forward, and outline the research trends in terms of solutions to mitigate these challenges."

The large number of things (objects), which are connected to the Internet, produce a huge amount of data that needs a lot of effort and processing operations to transfer it to useful information. Moreover, the organization and control of this large volume of data requires novel ideas in the design and management of the IoT network to accelerate and enhance its performance. The software defined systems is a new paradigm that appeared recently to hide all complexity in traditional system architecture by abstracting all the controls and management operations from the underling devices (things in the IoT) and setting them inside a middleware layer, a software layer. In this work, a comprehensive software defined based framework model is proposed to simplify the IoT management process and provide a vital solution for the challenges in the traditional IoT architecture to forward, store, and secure the produced data from the IoT objects by integrating the software defined network, software defined storage, and software defined security into one software defined based control model.",
